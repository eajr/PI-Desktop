/**
 * The Stage Manager bounds watchdog is macOS-only (D447).
 *
 * Behavioral: the platform rule is the whole decision — macOS keeps the
 * recovery watchdog, every other platform turns it off.
 *
 * Contract: `createWindow` clears the interval before it can read bounds or
 * re-layer the window, so no platform other than macOS repeats a
 * `setAlwaysOnTop(false)` that a window manager answers by raising the window.
 *
 * Security (D657): window bounds recovery never executes an external helper.
 * The former `/tmp/pi-window-bounds` CoreGraphics helper ran from a
 * world-writable path on every watchdog tick, packaged builds included.
